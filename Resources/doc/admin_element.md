# Admin elements

Admin panel is build from admin elements. Admin element is nothing more that element in menu. So next thing you
should do after installation is creating few admin elements.

Admin elements have different types, at the moment you can choose from

* [Doctrine CRUD (Create Read Update Delete)](Resources/doc/admin_element_crud.md)
* [Doctrine Resource](Resources/doc/admin_element_resource_md)


If default element types are not enough you can use [event system](Resources/doc/events.md) to modify admin elements
behavior.
